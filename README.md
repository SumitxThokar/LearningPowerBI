## Day 1 of learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: Power BI Desktop is a free application for PCs that lets you gather, transform, and visualize your data. Onto the journey of learning Power BI, today I explored the report building environment in Power BI Desktop, connect to data sources and import data.  <br>
### Power BI Desktop Environment.
Let's get familiar with the environment.
![Power BI Environment](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/02-power-bi-desktop-areas.png)
**Ribbon** - Displays common tasks that are associated with reports and visualizations.<br>
**Report view, or canvas** - Where visualizations are created and arranged. You can switch between Report, Data, and Model views by selecting the icons in the left column.<br>
**Pages tab** - Located along the bottom of the page, this area is where you would select or add a report page.<br>
**Visualizations pane** - Where you can change visualizations, customize colors or axes, apply filters, drag fields, and more.<br>
**Fields pane** - Where query elements and filters can be dragged onto the Report view or dragged to the Filters area of the Visualizations pane.<br>

### Connecting to data sources and import data.
![Get Data](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/data_soruce.png)
One can easily get data from any format of file. Power BI supports more than 60 applications and format of data. For now let's get data from excel. <br>
![From Excel](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/getdatafromexcel.png)
Now the navigator tab will pop up from where you can select which table data you want to work on. Clicking on the load botton will load the data in Power BI Desktop.
You can easily see the data from **Report view pane> Data Model**. <br>

## Day 2 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On the journey of learing Power BI, Today I learned transforming data with the help of power query.<br>
Before loading data in Power BI, we can transform the data by clicking transform buttom instead of load in Navigator tab. Or You can also transform the data after the data is loaded by clicking on to the transform button.<br>
![Transform](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/powerBI11.png)<br>
Changing the datatype of the data can be done easily by right-clicking on the column you want to change the datatype then >Change datatype.
<br>
## Day 3 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On the journey of learning Power BI. Today I learned to create basic visuals and formatting them to beautify them.<br>
- After getting the data. I started creating visuals using Visualization pane. Visualization pane has more than 30 visuals to work on. 
- I started with simple Colmnn Chart. After selecting the Column Chart, I dragged and dropped the data which I want to visualize in X-axis and Y-axis label in Visualization pane from Fields. <br>
#### Before 
![Before](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/salesvscategory.png)
- To customize the look of my chart I use the "Format Visual" menu. I explored and learn to customize the column quite well. You can see few of my learning in the image down below.
#### After

## Day 4 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On the journey of learning Power BI. Today, I had the opportunity to delve deeper into the world of Power BI and explore some of the basic chart types available. I was struck by the power of visuals to convey information in a much more impactful way than simple tables. They allow for the storytelling of numbers through beautiful, eye-catching designs.<br>
#### Stacked Column Chart
One of the charts I began with was the stacked column chart, which is similar to a standard column chart but with the added feature of labels. This allows for an even more detailed understanding of the data being presented. As an example, take a look at this image:
![Stacked Column Chart](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/visual1.png)
In addition to the stacked column chart, I also had the opportunity to create other types of visuals such as **pie chart**, **donut chart**, **funnel chart**, and **ribbon chart**. The ease of creating these visuals with Power BI was impressive, and I highly recommend anyone working with data to give it a try. One tip I would offer is to pay close attention and work on your own with the format pane as it is what really brings a visual to life and makes it stand out.
<br>
Overall, it was a productive and enlightening day, and I am excited to continue learning and experimenting with the various chart types available in Power BI. Here are some of the visuals I was able to create:
![Pie Chart](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/visual2.png)
![donut Chart](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/visual3.png)
![funnel Chart](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/visual4.png)
![Ribbon Chart](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/visual5.png)

## Day 5 of Learning Power BI
:writing_hand: Today, I focused on creating and formatting tables in the software. First, I created a simple table by clicking on the table button in the visualization pane and then dragging and dropping the columns I wanted to work with into the column section. I also learned how to arrange the data in ascending or descending order by simply clicking on the header of the column.
<br>
### Creating a table.
![Create table](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/ct1.jpg)
<br>

Next, I played around with formatting the table by increasing its size using the format section.
### After formatting the table.
![Formatting](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/format.jpg)
<br>
Finally, I explored the use of conditional formatting in tables. I discovered that by right clicking on values in the column section, a bar of options appears. By clicking on conditional formatting, I was able to customize the data bars, background color and icons to make the table look more visually appealing.
<br> 
### Using Conditional Formatting.

Overall, it was a productive day in my Power BI learning journey and I am excited to continue exploring the software's capabilities.

## Day 6 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On my journey of learning power BI. Today I learned to use matrix table, map, filled map, formatting them and created a simple dashboard on my own.
<br>Matrix in Power BI allows for a more organized and readable display of data, particularly when there are repeated values within subcategories. It also allows for easy creation of a matrix table from a regular table, and provides the ability to add rows as needed. Additionally, matrix tables allow for the use of hierarchies, which can further enhance the organization and readability of the data. Using a matrix table can also help convey information better than a regular table.
<br>
![Heirarchy](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/heirarchy.jpg)
<br>
Formatting the matrix table is very similar to formatting table.
**Maps**<br>

<br>
## Day 7 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On my journey of learning Power BI. Today I visualized other charts like: <br>
**Line Chart**<br>
A line chart is a graphical representation of data that uses points connected by lines to show trends or changes over time.<br>
![Line Chart](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/linechart.jpg)
<br>
Drill down in a line chart allows the user to zoom in on specific sections of the chart for more detailed analysis.<br>
**Area Chart**<br>
An area chart is similar to a line chart, but the area below the line is filled in to show the magnitude of change over time.<br>
![Area Chart](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/areachart.jpg)
<br>
**Line and column chart**<br>
A line and column chart combines elements of both line and column charts to display multiple sets of data.
![Line COlumn chart](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/linecolumnchart.jpg)
<br>
**Scatter Plot**<br>
A scatter plot is a graph that uses dots(bubbles) to represent values for two different numeric variables. It can be used to show the relationship between the two variables and it is the only chart which by default have animation in power BI.<br>
![Scatter plot](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/Scatterplot.jpg)
<br>
## Day 8 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand:
**Waterfall chart**<br>
![Waterfall](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/waterfall.jpg)
<br>
A waterfall chart in Power BI is a type of chart that is used to visualize the cumulative effect of a series of positive and negative values. It is often used to show changes in a value over time, such as changes in revenue or expenses. The chart displays a series of bars that represent the individual values, with the overall effect of the changes illustrated by the movement of the bars up or down. Waterfall charts in Power BI can be customized to include different colors and labels to help communicate important information.<br>
**TreeMap**<br>
![TreeMap](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/Tree.jpg)
<br>
A treemap in Power BI is a type of chart that visually displays hierarchical data as nested rectangles. The size and color of the rectangles indicate the relative value and grouping of the data. You can hover over the rectangles to see more detailed information and use the drill-through feature to explore the data in more depth. It is a useful tool for displaying hierarchical data and understanding the proportion of each level of the hierarchy.<br>
**Gauge chart**<br>
![Gauge](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/gauge.jpg)
<br>
Gauge is used to compare target.A gauge chart in Power BI is a type of chart that is used to visualize a single value in relation to a target or range. It is often used to show progress towards a goal or to compare a current value to a desired value. The chart displays a needle or marker that indicates the current value, with the target or range illustrated by a circular or radial scale. Gauge charts in Power BI can be customized to include different colors and labels to help communicate important information and the progress towards the target.
<br>
## Day 9 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: **Number Card**<br>
In Power BI, a "Number card" is a type of visualization that can be used to display data in a dashboard or report.
A Number card is a simple visualization that displays a single value, often used to show a key performance indicator (KPI) or other important metric. It can be customized to display the value in different formats, such as currency or percentage, and can also include a trend arrow or a sparkline to show changes over time.<br>
![Number Card](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/number.jpg)

## Day 10 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: **Formatting in Number Card**<br>
In Power BI, formatting a number card to include a shadow and adjusting the border involves using the formatting options available in the "Format" section of the Power BI interface. To add a shadow to the number card, you can access the "Format" section and look for the "Shape" or "Style" options. Here you will find the option to add a shadow to the card. To adjust the border of the number card, you can also access the "Format" section and look for the "Border" options. Here you will find options to adjust the thickness, color, and style of the border. Additionally, you can use other formatting options, like fill color or transparency, to enhance the overall look and feel of the card. 
<br>

## Day 11 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On my journey of learning power BI, Today I learned to visualize Date Card, Filters in Date card, about Relative filtering and Multi row card in power BI.<br>
One of the most useful features in data visualization is the ability to filter by relative dates. This allows you to quickly and easily see how your data changes over time. By using this filter in various visuals, you can gain a deeper understanding of the trends and patterns in your data.
<br>
Another powerful feature is the ability to use multi-row cards. While other visuals may only provide a single feature, multi-row cards allow you to display multiple features at once. This can be especially useful when working with large datasets or when trying to identify correlations between different data points.
<br>
![Multi row](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/multirow.jpg)
Together, these features provide a powerful toolset for exploring and understanding your data. With the ability to filter by relative dates and display multiple features at once, you can gain a deeper understanding of your data and make more informed decisions.

## Day 12 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On my journey of learning power BI, I learned to Filter on page, visuals and all pages. <br>
In Power BI, filters can be applied at three different levels: visual level, page level, and report level.
- Visual level filters apply only to a specific visual on a page, and do not affect the other visuals on the same page.
- Page level filters apply to all visuals on a single page, but do not affect the other pages in the report.
- Report level filters apply to all visuals on all pages in the report.


You can use these different levels of filters to control the data that is displayed in your report and to create dynamic and interactive visualizations.
### Filter on Visuals.

## Day 13 of learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On my journey of Learning Power BI, Today I learned about drill through and its advantages in power BI.<br>
In Power BI, a "drill through" feature allows users to click on a data point in a visual and see more detailed information related to that data point. This feature can be used to navigate and explore data at a more granular level.
<br>
To use the drill through feature in Power BI, you first need to create a visual and add the data you want to drill through to it. Then, you need to enable the drill through feature for that visual by going to the "Visualizations" pane, selecting the visual, and clicking on the "Drillthrough" button. Once the drill through feature is enabled, you can click on any data point in the visual to drill through to the detailed data.
<br>
The advantages of using drill through in Power BI include:
- It allows users to explore data at a more granular level, which can help them to understand the data better.
- It enables users to easily access detailed information related to a specific data point, without having to navigate through multiple screens or reports.
- It can be used to create a more interactive and engaging user experience.
- It allows users to access to more information which can help them to make more informed decisions.
Overall, drill through is a powerful feature that can help users to better understand and explore data in Power BI.

## Day 14 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On my journey of learning Power BI, I visualized about Slicer in text.
### Slicer in Text
![In Text](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/slicer.jpg)


In Power BI, a text slicer allows you to filter data based on a specific text value or pattern. To use a text slicer, you first need to create a table or column that contains the text values you want to filter on. Then, you can add a text slicer to your report, and select the table or column as the field to filter on.
<br>
Advantages of using text slicers in Power BI include:
- They allow you to quickly filter data based on specific text values or patterns, making it easier to find the information you need.
- They are easy to use, and can be added to a report with just a few clicks.

## Day 15 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On my journey of learning Power BI, I learned to format Text slicer.<br>
To format a text slicer in Power BI, you can do the following:
- Select the slicer visual on the report canvas.
- Go to the Format pane on the right.
- Under the "General" section, you can change the font size, color, and alignment of the text.
- Under the "Slicer" section, you can change the background color, border, and spacing of the slicer.
- You can also change the way the items are displayed, such as a list or a dropdown, and the layout of the items.
- Click "Apply" to save your changes.

![Formatting](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/formatting.jpg)

## Day 16 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand: On my journey of learning Power BI, I learned about Bate Slicer and its uses in Power BI.
### Date Slicer
A date slicer in Power BI is a visual tool that allows users to filter data by date range. It is typically used in dashboards and reports to allow users to easily view data for specific periods of time, such as a specific month or quarter. Date slicers can be used to filter data in multiple visualizations or tables on a dashboard, making it easy for users to analyze data for a specific time period. They are also customizable, allowing users to change the date range, format, and style of the slicer to fit their needs.

![Date Slicer](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/dateslicer.jpg)

## Day 18 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand:On your journey of learning Power BI, Today I had the opportunity to create visually stunning and advanced charts that may not be immediately available within the platform. One such example is the animated bar chart race, which can add an interactive and dynamic element to your data visualization. To import advanced charts such as this, you will first need a Power BI account. Once you have one, you can access the visualization pane and look for the ellipsis button. By clicking on this button and then selecting the "Get More Visuals" option, you will be able to add advanced charts to your Power BI project and take your data visualization to the next level.


![](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/more.jpg)
### Animated Bar chart Race.
An animated bar chart race is a type of chart that animates the transition of data over time. It is essentially a sequence of bar charts that shows how the relative values of different categories change over time. The chart typically starts with the data for the first time period, and then animates the transition to the next time period, showing how the values of the different categories change. It can be useful for visualizing trends over time, and it can be created in Power BI using the "Play Axis" and "Synchronized Playback" features.


![Barchart Race](https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/barchartrace.jpg)


## Day 19 of Learning Power BI.
:writing_hand:On your journey of learning Power BI, Today I observed more of advanced charts (i.e Drill down column chart and Drill down donut chart) in power BI.<br>
### Drill-down Column chart
A drill-down column chart in Power BI is a type of chart that allows users to drill down into the data by clicking on a specific column. This allows users to see more detailed information about the data represented by that column. 


<img src="https://github.com/SumitxThokar/LearningPowerBI/blob/main/images/drilldowncolumn.jpg">


### Drill-down donut chart
 A drill-down donut chart is similar, but it is a donut chart rather than a column chart. This type of chart allows users to drill down into the data by clicking on a specific segment of the donut. Both of these chart types can be useful for visualizing hierarchical data and for allowing users to explore data at different levels of detail.
