## Day 1 of learning Power BI.
Power BI Desktop is a free application for PCs that lets you gather, transform, and visualize your data. Onto the journey of learning Power BI, today I explored the report building environment in Power BI Desktop, connect to data sources and import data.  <br>
### Power BI Desktop Environment.
Let's get familiar with the environment.

**Ribbon** - Displays common tasks that are associated with reports and visualizations.<br>
**Report view, or canvas** - Where visualizations are created and arranged. You can switch between Report, Data, and Model views by selecting the icons in the left column.<br>
**Pages tab** - Located along the bottom of the page, this area is where you would select or add a report page.<br>
**Visualizations pane** - Where you can change visualizations, customize colors or axes, apply filters, drag fields, and more.<br>
**Fields pane** - Where query elements and filters can be dragged onto the Report view or dragged to the Filters area of the Visualizations pane.<br>

### Connecting to data sources and import data.

One can easily get data from any format of file. Power BI supports more than 60 applications and format of data. For now let's get data from excel. <br>

Now the navigator tab will pop up from where you can select which table data you want to work on. Clicking on the load botton will load the data in Power BI Desktop.
You can easily see the data from **Report view pane> Data Model**. <br>
## Day 2 of Learning Power BI.
On the journey of learing Power BI, Today I learned transforming data with the help of power query.<br>
Before loading data in Power BI, we can transform the data by clicking transform buttom instead of load in Navigator tab. Or You can also transform the data after the data is loaded by clicking on to the transform button.

Changing the datatype of the data can be done easily by right-clicking on the column you want to change the datatype then >Change datatype.
